Twice in the last little while, I have become aware of a person being fired for doing something entirely unrelated to their job function, something that was conducted outside of their employer's offices.

The first one concerned an individual who aided and abetted various discussion groups devoted to the objectification of women of various ages amongst other things. I'm personally disgusted by the fruits of his labours.

The second one concerned an individual at a technical conference who conducted himself in a manner not permitted by its code of conduct. His photo found its way onto the Interwebs, and his fifteen minutes of fame started a chain reaction of events ending with his dismissal.

Both men are fathers with mouths to feed and health insurance to fund.

The feelings I can print without aggressive use of the entire Unicode character set are that in these two incidents we see a real problem with "at will" employment. I have two objections to it, one moral, one practical.

I will start with the moral one first. These men were hired to perform a certain job, and that job is technical. They are not celebrities selling their likeness and "image," they are professionals selling a service. There has been no suggestion they were dismissed "for cause." I think their employers have acted legally, but nevertheless are morally wrong.

My practical argument is of an entirely different character. I do not consider the men the victims, but the employers. Here's what I think, speaking as someone who has worn the manager's hat for much of my career.

### the manager's perspective

A client calls me up. "What the Fuck! have you seen what Smith has done?"

No, I haven't. I listen politely while the client rages about an off-colour post Smith has made on Twitter. Smith is an otherwise valued member of the team, although I'd rather not be having this conversation.

"Listen, Braithwaite, do you condone this kind of thing?"

Absolutely not.

"So what are you going to do about it?"

Here's where the road forks. In Ontario, I can commiserate with the client but I tell them: "Regrettably, my hands are tied." If Smith hasn't run afoul of the legal standards for employment as set down in statute and case law, I cannot sack him for what he says on Twitter.

I listen and sympathize and offer a formal written distancing of ourselves from Smith's remarks and naturally promise to be generous with the Fire and Brimstone when Smith pedals his fixie into the office at noon. And if they want Smith off their project, well, that is their right, and we'll do our best to ensure there is no service disruption.

After some time, I will patch thing sup and keep the client and a good employee. And of course I will make sure Smith understands that actions have consequences. But in the end, I want a good client and a good employee, and if someone is to be fired, I want to decide for myself, not to have to make a decision with the cameras rolling and the flash-bulbs popping.

I think that not having "at will" employment actually strengthens my hand in this case.

Whereas, if I'm sitting in SF when I take this call, what can I do? Smith is employed at my pleasure and my client knows it. I have zero leverage when the client calls to demand that I cc: them on Smith's written termination letter.

And so I find myself searching for a new employee on my client's timetable. I don't have the luxuty of giving Smith a warning, I can't negotiate him onto another team, I can't even retain him but quietly let him go a few weeks later.

I have to fire him right now, and everybody knows it.

How is this a win for me as a manager? How is this a win for my employer? And how does this make my city, state, or country "more competitive in business?"

I won't generalize and say that all employee-positive laws are also business-positive, but I do feel that "at will employment" isn't always a net benefit for the employer. High-profile cases, which are becoming more and more common in the age of the Internet, seem to me to be swinging the balance against it.
