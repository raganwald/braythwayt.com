First we came for the labourers  
And I did not speak out  
Because I was not a labourer.

I was a Technologist, I was the one creating the automation that obsoleted the labourers.

Then they came for the journalists  
And I did not speak out  
Because I was not a journalist.

I was a Technologist, I was the one creating the social media that drove the journalists from invetigators and fact-checkers into algorithms for maximizing clicks running on meatspace hardware.

Then they came for the service workers  
And I did not speak out  
Because I was not a service worker.

I was a Technologist, I was the one creating the gig economy that pushed them into living in their ride-sharing vehicles.

[Then they came for the technologists](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1600119268858744832)  
And I did not speak out  
Because if someone could be eliminated, they were obviously weak, a parasite, a freeloader, a disease that needed to be cleansed by capitalism. And I knew that the first to go are always those who are last to cheer for the leaders. And I was a loyal footsoldier.

And they will never come for me  
There is no reason to speak out  
Because I am extremely hardcore, I sleep in the office, I optimize my code for weekly episodes of "survivor code review," and I never criticize leadership, even in private.
