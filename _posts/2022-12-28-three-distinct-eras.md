> For a few years, a man born before powered flight began (in 1903) and who had grown up without motorized transportation (before roughly 1918) could be plowing a field with a horse, look up to the sky and see an intercontinental nuclear bomber or a flying wing jet bomber roaring overhead...less than 45 years after the very first powered flight in a fragile bundle of sticks and fabric.
It must have been simultaneously baffling and thrilling.
