Neither [braythwayt.com](braythwayt.com) nor [raganwald.com](http://raganwald.com) support comments. This is a deliberate choice.

I believe that discussion benefits from the context of a community. A discussion on Hacker News is a very different thing than a discussion on Reddit, which is a very different thing than a discussion on Facebook, which is again a different thing than a discussion on MetaFilter.

Each community has its own standards for discourse. I like civil, thoughtful discussions, others prefer a more rough-and-tumble free-for-all. I could impose any standard I like on comments I moderate, but having shoved my views down your throat, why should I cram my values down on top of them?

For this reason, I encourage readers to discuss my posts in the places where they already enjoy valuable discussion. In some cases, I will add links to those discussions. And if you prefer not to engage in discussion, that's fine with me, I'm not trying to socially engineer you into being "engaged with the content," just trying to share some thoughts with you.

Warm Regards,

Reg Braithwaite.
