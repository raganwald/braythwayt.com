So, the US government rammed CISPA through despite widespread opposition and a previous populist defeat. Shock, horror, outrage to discover that once again, lobbying interests outweigh the will of the public.

So complete was their victory that one of its supporters--I won't dignify him by mentioning his name--described opponents as "14 year-old basement tweeters." He's technically wrong, but of course he knows that and was merely trying to demonize thoughtful opposition.

But let's say he's right for the sake of an interesting discussion. What would it mean if, say, 100% of fourteen year-old internet-savvy teens was against something and 100% of politicians, lawyers, and businesspeople age 44 was in favour of it?

I'd say that history would be with the fourteen year-olds. So far, they've been a pretty good leading indicator. For one thing, they will be forty-four one day. For another, they grasp the implications of new ideas better than forty-four year-olds.

Michael Lewis explained it well. When you're 14, you aren't anybody yet. You aren't a lawyer yet. You aren't in business yet. You aren't a writer yet. You haven't voted yet. You don't pay taxes. You are a blank canvas, with no baggage. You don't have an identity yet, so you can adopt a new idea easily.

But at forty-four, you have an identity. To adopt something new, you have to push out something old, you have to reverse yourself. "I used to be against equality of marriage, but I've changed my mind. I used to believe IP was property, but not any more. I used to take $150,000 a year in graft, but not any more."

Even if I didn't already have an opinion on these issues, if it concerns the changing impact of technology on entertainment and communications, I'd lean towards betting on whatever the fourteen year-olds think is right.

If it isn't today, *it will be*. And sooner than we expect.
