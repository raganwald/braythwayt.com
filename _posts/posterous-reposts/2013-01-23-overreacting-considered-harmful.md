Imagine, if you will, that I came upon a conference spread featuring ten invited speakers. All of them are Asian women. I tweet that it looks great, but where are the caramel-coloured men?

I get a response back from the organizer. She's pissed. "We chose our speakers on merit. All of these are incredibly talented, qualified speakers with excellent experience presenting their subject matter. Asking me to have a quota is racist and sexist, which make YOU a racist and a sexist!"

Now I disagree with being called a racist and/or a sexist, and I definitely don't recall asking her to do anything of the sort. She's presuming a lot from my comment. And I'm going to engage her in discussion. But one thing I will not do: I'm not going to start by telling her that she's overreacting. And I'm grateful she didn't tell me that I'm overreacting.

Your reaction is your reaction. You can't "overreact" unless you are deliberately exaggerating for effect. And the correct response to that is "You're exaggerating." What most people mean, of course, is that your reaction is not in line with the actual circumstances. And that's what I plan to tell her.

But the best way to tell her that her response is not in line with the actual circumstances is to say that, not to use the word "overreacting." That one word has become poisonous. It is dripping with all sorts of baggage, like veiled suggestions that someone is hysterical or mentally unbalanced. You can't get a frank, productive exchange going if you start by lobbing a bouncing hand grenade into the room.

So instead, I'll simply tell her that the statements she makes are mistaken in fact. I'm not going to discuss her feelings or reactions, because to tell her that they are an "overreaction" is to criticize her as a person and to invalidate the feelings she has. For all I know, the previous 99 people to ask her about the women in her conference may have been rabid Mens Rights whhatchamacallits that left a bad taste in her mouth. Her fears may be reasonable given her experience, and what I need to do is explain where I'm coming from so that she sees this conversation will be different.

I think you get what I'm saying here. "Overreacting" has a certain dictionary meaning in theory, but in practice it has too much baggage to be an effective tool for discussion. No matter how outrageous someone's response may be, resist the temptation to use this word that is so closely tied to people's feelings. Instead, use other words that discuss people's words and arguments directly.
