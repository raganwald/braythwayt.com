Dear friends and readers:

Today I'm very pleased to announce that [JavaScript Spessore](https://leanpub.com/javascript-spessore) joins [JavaScript Allongé](https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge): They are both now "Free as in Speech." Both are licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_US). That means that you are free:

* to **Share**—to copy, distribute and transmit the work
* to **Remix**—to adapt the work
* to make **Commercial** use of the work

Read the license yourself for the full details. As I noted when discussing JavaScript Allongé, the usual expression is that the book is free. But a much better way to put it is that *you are free*. I still charge money for an ebook--and [here's my explanation why](http://braythwayt.com/2013/10/04/the-freedom-to-pay-thirty-bucks.html)--but you are free to obtain the book any way you like, free to share the book any way you like, and best of all, you are free to build upon the book, any ay you like.

* Do you want to give a copy to a friend? You can. 
* Do you want to blog about JavaScript and include as much (or as little) of the book on your own site? Go ahead.
* Do you want to make an Atom plugin that inseerts snippets from the book and uses the book as help text? Yes please!

I also made JavaScript Spessore [free to read online](https://leanpub.com/javascript-spessore/read). And [the markdown source](https://github.com/raganwald/javascript-spessore)is on GitHub. From now on, if you spot a mistake, you can [file an issue][issue], or better still, fork the manuscript and send me a [pull request][pull]!

### what is javascript spessore?

Programming languages are (loosely) defined by their basic activity. In FORTRAN, you program with numbers. In C, you program with pointers. In ML, you program with types. And in JavaScript, you program with functions.

Functions are very interesting building blocks for programs, because they *compose*: It's easy to build a programming style based on making many small things that can be combined and recombined to make bigger things. This is the basis of the vaunted "Unix Philosophy:" Learning to write small utilities and scripts that compose neatly. This is also the JavaScript philosophy: Make small things that can be combined and recombined to make bigger things.

Programmig with objects can be done in this style, and JavaScript makes it particularly easy to combine and recombine small parts. Classes can be built from traits instead of from superclasses. Objects can delegate and forward behaviour to helpers and meta-objects. Adaptors can be written to change an object's interface without needing to create another class in a hierarchy.

[JavaScript Spessore](https://leanpub.com/javascript-spessore) is a book that describes this approach to working with objects and metaobjects in JavaScript. It's exactly the same philosophy as you find in JavaScript Allongé, only it talks to programming with objects instead of programming with functions.

JavaScript Spessore will show you how to build JavaScript programs that scale in code, in time, and across a team, using the one technique that has passed the test of time: Objects and metaobjects that have a single responsibility, are decoupled from each other, and can be composed freely.

Go ahead, [read it for yourself](https://leanpub.com/javascript-spessore/read). After all, it's free.
