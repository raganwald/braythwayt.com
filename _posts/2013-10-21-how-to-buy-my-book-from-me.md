That edition is not published by me. The person or persons publishing it are 100% responsible for setting its price, and if you choose to purchase it from them, they keep 100% of the money you pay. I have no influence over its copy or quality.

Instead of authorizing or overseeing these other editions, I choose to offer [JavaScript Allongé](https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge) in three forms:

1. You can read the entire book [online](https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge/read), for free.
2. You can read, download, and/or fork the [markdown source](https://github.com/raganwald/javascript-allonge), again, for free.
3. You can purchase the ebook from me on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge). Leanpub is the *only* way to purchase the book from me and the only way that I receive any compensation for your purchase.

I have chosen to publish the book under a [free-as-in-speech license](http://braythwayt.com/2013/10/01/javascript-allonge-is-free.html). The bottom line is that if you have a copy of the book, *you* are free to distribute it for free, or for any price you like, whether less than I charge, or more. I grant you that freedom willingly, because I believe that the principles of freedom are more important to me than 76 cents, or $4, or whatever it is people choose to charge.

The people behind that "edition" are using the freedom I granted them. If you choose to purchase from them, I do not judge you. After all, I made this possible when I decided not to tell them what to do with information that wants to be free-as-in-speech. However, [if you choose to exercise your freedom to buy the book from me for thirty bucks, I think that would be a beautiful thing](http://braythwayt.com/2013/10/04/the-freedom-to-pay-thirty-bucks.html).

Cheers, and thanks for your email!
