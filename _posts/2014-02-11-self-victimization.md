A while back, I wrote a post called [optimism].

[optimism]: https://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/2009-05-01/optimism.md

It was couched as a fictional talk given at a fictional conference, but the content was sincere: I was sharing my `n = 1` experience with managing my moods using the techniques from Dr. Martin Seligman's book on [Learned Optimism]. One of the three key points from that book is that people are happier when they rationalize all the bad things in their life as coming from external forces, and all of the good things from themselves.

[Learned Optimism]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400078393?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=raganwald001-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1400078393

Furthermore, people are happier when they recognize that the bad things are very specific and very temporary. Bad things are depersonalized, put in a specific, limited scope, and exist only for a specific time. Example: I just wrote a little post about private methods in Ruby. Someone replied on Reddit that they preferred a completely different technique.

Using Seligman's methodology, I tell myself that:

1. This is a statement about one specific person's opinion, based on what they read and put into the context of their experiences.
2. This is obviously concerning one small point, the use of `def self.foo` in Ruby.
3. It's just one of many posts, on Reddit for a day or so and then forgotten.

Mind you, I also tell myself that:

1. The upvotes and praise for that post reflect well upon me.
2. People like it because they like what I have to say about Ruby and programming in general.
3. I've been writing good posts for a while, and I'll keep writing good posts for a while yet.

All good stuff, but don't take my word for it and don't run off and try to do what I just did. Go [read the damn book for yourself][Learned Optimism]!

Now onto a related subject: There's a thing where you **victimize** yourself. You say things somewhat like the narrative above about bad things coming from other people, but instead of also putting those bad things in as narrow and restricted a scope as possible, you go the other way.

If someone tweets that such-and-such a conference isn't diverse enough, it's evidence of an ongoing malignant conspiracy to destroy our culture. They're out to get us! (Yes, I do say "our" and "us," I enjoy quite a bit of privilege.) No matter how well off we are in objective fact, we can find a way to feel threatened and victimized by almost anything that seems to run counter to whatever we want to have going on right now.

It's not just conferences, of course, victimization is a trillion dollar industry. Victimization runs Fox News. Victimization powers social conservatism. Victimization is on the political left as well, it thrives wherever people let their reptilian brains and hormones to run their lives.

I speak from experience on this one, "Militant Raganwald" struts around like a Social Justice Warrior, but if history has taught us anything, it's that wars are always started by someone who convinces everyone else that their families and way of life are under attack.[^hymen]

The problem with victimization is that it is depressing. *For us*. Seriously, treating ourselves as victims feels like it motivates us to action, and thus it must be associated with action and taking charge. But it isn't associated with action, it's associated with *reaction*, with responding to the choices of others.

If I am walking in the forest and a wolf attacks me, I may drive it off or even kill it. Too bad for the wolf, I am the master. But note that I did not enter the forest to hunt for wolves, even if the wolf lies dead, it's choices dictated the course of my life, not my choices.

And so it is with perceiving everything as a threat. We may slay all these wolves, but unless we are dedicating our lives and purposes to the slaying of wolves, each "victory over the wolf" is actually a defeat in our real purposes. And it's all the more tragic a defeat when we slay the wolf, because we are consumed by the blood lust and the victory so much that we forget why we entered the forest in the first place.

Look, I am not saying that if a conference code of conduct makes you feel uncomfortable that you shouldn't speak out, just as I'm not saying that if a conference's lack of code of conduct makes you feel uncomfortable, that you shouldn't speak out.

I'm also not saying that it's a bad thing if you decide that the slaying of wolves (or the cleaning of the Augean Stables) is your purpose in life. Speak up! Act!! be the change you want to see in the world, with my blessing.

But I am saying that if you are trying to enjoy the forest for what it is, sometimes it makes sense to learn to avoid the wolves, or live amongst them in peace, or perhaps to see them, note your fear, and then take control of it and to make conscious choices.

To act rather than to react. That's really what I'm saying. Whenever we find ourselves thinking that we are victims, that we must respond immediately to threats, let's pause for a second. Let's ask if we really want to live our lives at the mercy of the rest of the world's choices.

Do we really, *really* want to be victims?
