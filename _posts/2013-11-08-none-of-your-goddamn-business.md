I want to go on record as saying this: *What someone consumes on their own personal time is their own goddamn business*. If it affects their job performance negatively, we don't need to diagnose the cause, we can observe and criticize the effects.

I'm cool with judging a person by whether they show up for work at noon. I'm also cool with saying it doesn't matter when they show up for work, as long as they're saving their employer a billion dollars. I'm especially cool with someone saying: **What I do in a private residence is none of your goddamn business.**

It's wrong to lament the government intruding into our private lives while simultaneously praising the press for doing *that exact same thing*. We don't have a public interest in knowing whether someone who has called for stiff jail sentences to be handed to drug addicts happens to do drugs in private. We're *interested*, but I don't think democracy will crumble if we don't have the right to film people when they have a reasonable expectation of privacy and violate that privacy.

Now we both know what and who we're talking about. But if you read a recent blog post of mine, you'll know that I've reserved my greatest criticism for the behaviour of his "supporters," people who are highly non-constructive in both politics and discussion. I think that man made a massive mistake in denying--through lies and misleading technicalities--the existence of a video or of his behaviour.

I honestly think democracy would have been better off had he simply said: "It's none of your goddamn business." Naturally there would have been criticism. Naturally people would have called for a firm statement about his private habits. But that would have been a principled stand.

Not "I cannot comment on a video," but rather: "I refuse to comment on a video that purports to show something that is none of your goddamn business." Because now it's too late. I can easily stuff the video back into the bottle. I cannot evade the fact that by answering the question of what a man does or doesn't do in his private life, he legitimized the debate.

Now that he denied it, it's too late to say, "What does any of this have to do with his performance?" *What he may or may not have done on his private time is no longer the question*. Instead, the question now is what he did on-the-job: Lied, evaded, and maintained intimate relationships involving clandestine packet exchanges with people now charged with extortion in connection with a video purported to show something that is none of our goddamn business.

And that is all "on the job:" Lying to the people or misleading the people using excuses my five year-old wouldn't try is our goddamn business. Conducting clandestine meetings involving packet exchanges is our goddamn business.

Quite honestly, I wish he had simply said: "It's none of your goddamn business."

Because now, we run the risk of people thinking that what someone consumes on their own private time is my goddamn business. And it isn't. Lying, cheating, and dirty dealing are my goddamn business. Democracy, like private-sector employment, works just fine if we stick to judging what people write on the company letterhead, do in the company office, and say to their employers.

Everything else is none... but you know the rest.
