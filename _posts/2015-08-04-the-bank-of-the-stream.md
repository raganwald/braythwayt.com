The master approached a novice. “Walk with me,” he said, and they strolled through the perfectly maintained temple gardens. “My young novice, your thoughts are disturbed, your face clouded. What is it that disturbs your harmony?”

The novice hesitated, then confessed. “Master, I am troubled by thoughts of anger. Although I meditate ceaselessly and have trained my body to fulfill my will, I was bested in the sparring rituals by someone who barely bothers to practice and sleeps through the recitations of the scriptures. I have been unable to eat or sleep for days.”

The master nodded. “I learned this lesson when I myself was a novice. While traveling with my own master to take part in the Gathering of the Fighting Monks, we came upon a splendidly dressed woman crying beside a stream.  My master inquired as to her troubles, and she explained that she was on her way to a wedding, but crossing the stream would spoil her dress. My master picked her up and carried her across the stream in her arms, and then we walked along a while.”

I was aghast, and my master detected my distress much as I detected yours. He asked me to explain, and I was honest with him. “Master,” I asked, “Our vows prohibit us from contacting the flesh of women, and yet you embraced that woman in your arms. You, a master! What does this mean??”

My master was surprised. “My young apprentice, “ he chided, “I did carry her, but then I put her down on the bank of the stream. Why do you still carry her?”

The novice listened to this story, and the full import washed over him. It *was* important to let the past go. The past was finished. The future was no yet set, the only thing that mattered was this moment, here, now. He must be true to this moment and not be chained to yesterday or futilely chasing tomorrow.

His face took on an expression of resolve, his eyes flashed, his jaw set. And then he let out a terrific roundhouse kick, felling his master like a tree cut down in the forest. As his master lay, limbs akimbo in the flowerbed where he had fallen, the novice strolled away, head held high.

His parting words were succinct: “Master, leave **that** by the bank of the stream!”
