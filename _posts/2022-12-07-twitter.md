I have left Twitter, likely permanently. While there's a lot to be said about literal Nazis and the vital necessity of being [intolerant of intolerance][paradox], the simplest explanation for my personal choice is the best:

I have belonged to a lot of clubs, hangouts, and groups both in real life and online in BBS's, CompuServe, and many other social mediums. In absolutely every case where there was one all-powerful moderator who personally picked who could stay and who would be banned, and did so capriciously, things always went shitwards.

And things went shitwards doubly-quick when that one all-powerful moderator was themselves a shit-poster, and gathered around them a cliqué of toadies bathing them in affirmation and ready to brigade anyone who challened the status quo. Arguing with despots and their boot-licking followers never improved anything. In my personal experience, it would reinforce the despot's power by advertising to the world that no matter how cogent and sensible arguments might be, the despot's [id] would always win.

An all-powerful single moderator creates the ultimate conservative society. As I used to be fond of quoting on Twitter:

> Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit:
>
> There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect.

-—Frank Wilhoit, [Crooked Timber], 2018

Thus, I choose to leave: Regardless of what the despot's claimed politics or objectives are, regardless of what rules they pretend to set up and follow, Twitter is now a conservative social club. And it's run by a capricious shit-poster for his own ego. It may be advertised as a town square, but it's pretty obvious who the in-group is, and who the out-groups are.

YMMV, of course. If you have chosen to stay, good luck!
