I have left Twitter, likely permanently. While there's a lot to be said about literal Nazis and the vital necessity of being intorlerant of intolerance, the simplest explanation for my personal choice is the best:

I have belonged to a lot of clubs, hangouts, and groups both in real life and online in BBS's, CompuServe, and many other social mediums. In absolutely every case where there was one all-powerful moderator who personally picked who could stay and who would be banned, and did so capriciously, things always went shitwards. And things went shitwards doubly-quick when that one all-powerful moderator was themselves a shit-poster and gathered around them a cliqué of toadies ready to brigade anyone who challened teh status quo.

Arguing with them and their boot-licking followers didn't improve anything. In my personal experience, it would reinforce the despot's power by advertising to the world that no matter how cogent and sensible arguments might be, the despot's [id] will always win. An all-powerful single moderator creates the ultimate conservative society. As I used to be fond of  quoting on Twitter:

> Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit:
>
> There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect.

-—Frank Wilhoit, [Crooked Timber], 2018

This is why I personally choose to leave, rather than tilting at windmills trying to "stay and fight:" Regardless of what the despot's claimed politics or objectives are, regardless of what rules they pretend to set up and follow, to me Twitter is now nothing more and nothing less than a private club run by a capricious shit-poster for his own ego.

YMMV, of course. If you have chosen to stay, good luck!
