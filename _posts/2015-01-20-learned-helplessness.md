There are a few ideas that have helped shape my evolution as a human being. I've written about one, [Learned Optimism] by Dr. Martin Seligman. Today I'm writing about another idea that was also developed by Dr. Seligman, [Learned Helplessness].

Seligman's research methodology has attracted a great deal of criticism, as it involved electrically shocking animals, and inducing a kind of depression. The resulting "learned helplessness" is so debilitating, that the methodology has been used by others to torture human beings.

Seligman claims that his work was done to help humans *avoid* depression, and that is the spirit in which I encourage learning about Learned Helplessness.

### what is helplessness?

To be "helpless" is to believe that we do not have control over our own happiness. People describe this feeling in different ways. They may say that they are "stuck." Or "in a rut." To be stuck in life has nothing to do with how much money we make, or whether we are healthy, or loved, or admired. It is to feel like what happens to we is not under our control.

Obviously, people feel bad when bad things happen to them. But what surprised me was that how bad we feel is more closely correlated to our feeling of helplessness than the magnitude of the bad thing itself.

For example: I once played a lot of backgammon and poker for money, sometimes very large sums relative to my net worth. I often lost. But it didn't bother me, because I was convinced that I was a good player and that I won more often than I lost, and that when playing a lesser opponent, I would make larger wins when I won and lose lesser amounts when I lost.

I didn't feel helpless about the times I'd lose a game, or a pot, or even accept a bad double and get gammoned. In the box of a big [chouette].

Whereas, I vividly recall being bullied about my colour in primary school. It felt like mo matter what I did, the bullying continued. It was very depressing, and as we can see, that memory has never left me. But what do taunts matter? Very little, even in aggregate. It's not the taunts that hurt a ltttle black boy in 1968, it was the experience of being able to do nothing about them.

To summarize, "helplessness" is a the feeling that we can't control our own happiness. When people feel helpless about bad things that happen to them, it is more depressing and debilitating than the impact of the bad things themselves.

### the circles of concern and influence

In [The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People][7h], Stephen Covey wrote about a similar mechanism. He proposed the following thought exercise: Take a sheet of paper, and draw a venn diagram on it. One circle is our "circle of concern," it represents the things we care about. The other circle is our "circle of influence," the things we believe we can control.

For most people, the circle of concern surrounds and envelops the circle of influence. We care about many more thaings than we believe we can change.

The difference between them represents things we care about, but believe we can't change. This is unhealthy! We worry about such things, but feel helpless to make them better. Covey argued that we need to align the two circles, to learn how to expand our circle of influence, and also to shrink our circle of concern. When the two are in perfect alignment, we are happiest.

### what is learned helplessness?

If "helplessness" is the feeling that we cannot control our own happiness, "learned helplessness" is helplessness that is aquired from our environment. Helplessness we learn from our experience.

> In learned helplessness studies, an animal is repeatedly exposed to an aversive stimulus which it cannot escape. Eventually, the animal stops trying to avoid the stimulus and behaves as if it is helpless to change the situation. When opportunities to escape become available, learned helplessness means the animal does not take any action.--[Wikipedia][Learned Helplessness]

Seligman's research established that helplessness can be learned, primarily by repeatedly placing the subject in a situation where bad things happen to them, and they have no control over the outcome.

To accelerate this process, we provide affordances for control, but teach the subjects that the affordances are unreliable.

For example, say we have a [Prisoner], and we want to induce learned helplessness. In that case, we allow them to hatch escape plots, and even to get started on their escape, but we always catch them after they think they've gotten away, and thus we teach them that no matter how much control it appears they have, they don't really have any control.

[Prisoner]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prisoner

This is far worse than putting them in a prison where it appears that there is no escape. To return to the "circles" exercise, learned helplessness is the process of shrinking our circle of influence, of learning that we have far less influence than we thought.

### unlearning helplessness

This is far from an "academic" observation. Humans are not rats in a trap. For one thing, we can observe our own response to stimuli, and then treat ourself with stimuli of our own.

For example, an employee might work for an organization where there is a suggestion box, and wher ethey are encouraged to make suggestions, but the suggestions are never acted upon. After a while, they lose hope and stop making suggestions.

This is learned helplessness.

But all is not lost. The employee can agitate for transparency around the decision-making process. The employee can focus their efforts on activities where they have more control over the outcome. In an extreme case, the employee can move to an organization where the environment ismore receptive to their ideas.

Recognizing that they have become discouraged by the suggestion box, the employee can help themselves unlearn helplessness.

There is no way to ensure that the suggestion box will one day be a positive fixture for the employee. But it is possible to make sure that the suggestion box does not induce depression and pessimism.

*Unlearning helplessness is an important life skill*.

The world is full of stimuli that knowingly or accidentally encourage a feeling of helplessness. It's not just receiving negative stimuli, like reading about unhappy things on Twitter. It's being given an affordance that does not effect change, like tweeting about something bad and not having anything change.

There are lots of such things in the world. But the good news is, they learned helplessness is not inevitable. Armed with the knowledge of what they are, and an honest self-appraisal, we can unlearn our helplessness.

### strategy number one for unleaarning helplessness

Let's get the big strategy out of the way immediately. Some people and some environments are toxic for we as a person, because they are constantly teaching we to be helpless. It is not our fault that someone we love--a partner, even a parent--has toxic behaviours like arbitrarily offering approval and then snatching it back. Or has a substance abuse problem.

These kinds of behaviours are not only negative to us, but they do not respond to our attempts to fix them. They just don't, and it teaches us to feel helpless. Which makes us depressed and sometimes even suicidal.

I am not an expert on this subject, but if we recognize that someone we care about is teaching we to feel helpless, stop worrying about how to get them into therapy, and go see someone ourself, about our unhappiness. our mood is something we do have control over, and taking charge of our own happiness teaches we that we ren't helpless after all.

Helpless to change someone else? Yes. But not helpless to change ourself.

Likewise, some environments are toxic to us through no fault of any one person. Good people gathered in a group sometimes do ugly things to people, and if it seems impossible to change a toxic person, that problem pales in comparison to changing a toxic environment.

The worst such environments for us are the ones full of intelligent people with good intentions. This is like an environment where there are "false affordances." Each person we talk to is trying to help we be happy, but none of the strategies work because the environment as a whole resists every single thing we try.

The net effect again is learned helplessness, the feeling that we are powerless to effect meaningful change for ourselves or for the environment as a whole.

They may be good people, we need not crticize them as people. But we need to accept that the behaviour of a single otherwsie-good person, or the behaviour of good people when embedded within a certain kind of environment, can teach us to feel helpless.

When we have people or circumstances that teach us to be helpless, sometimes we have to separate ourselves fromm them. It's often the one thing we really can control.

Rats cannot escape from the scientist's maze. Humans can.

### strategy number two for unlearning helplessness

Another strategy for "unstucking ourselves" is to adopt Stephen Covey's methodology. Think about our circles of concern and influence, and consciously shring our circle of concern to match our perceived circle of incluence.

If we are continually getting shut down on suggestions, stop making suggestions. That's really depressing if we want to help craft the future, but maybe, just maybe, we don't really want to craft the future. Maybe we make suggestions because we perceive that's how to gain approval from our colleagues.

If what we really want is approval, we can find other ways to gain approval. Focus our concern on the things that really matter to we, and focus our activities on the things that produce actual results.

It isn't always a big, bad toxic person in our life, or a big, bad, toxic environment. Sometimes it's that we have misaligned circles of concern and influence, and we are investing our energies in areas where our actions do not make us happier, so *we* are teaching ourselves to be helpless.

The solution is to look hard at what we care about, and to focus on that portion that lies within our control. Sometimes that does mean a catastropic change in our environment, but often the hard work is in self-examination, in recognizing what really matters, and thus changing our behaviour so that our activities are within our circle of influence.

As we do things, and we perceive that those things effect change on things we actually care about, we unlearn our helplessness.

### the vital importance of change

Everyone has some exposure to learned helplessness. It's not a bad thing. If you imagine that the world is full of randomly arranged people and circumstances, some of them are bound to create an environment that offer promises of making positive change, but constantly dash our hopes.

Our job is not to lament such things, but to figure out how to avoid becoming emotionally ensnared by them. We must either change our circumstances, or change ourselves. We cannot allow a feeling of helplessness to ovewhelm our ability to escape from a toxic situation.

It's almost paradoxical: Sometimes, we have to accept that we are powerless to effect change, in order to effeect change.
