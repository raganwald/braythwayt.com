At one point in my life, I tended to a koi pond. I had a "koi guy." And one day, my koi guy showed me a koi he thought I might like. I looked it over at his place, but demurred, pointing out some of its flaws. My koi guy lisened, then got vert serious with me.

"Reg," he said, "There are two kinds of koi people. One kind love koi. Big koi, small koi, perfect koi, imperfect koi. They love the hobby, they love the fish. The other kind are different. They are deeply invested in the hobby, but instead of focusing on what they love, they focus on the blemishes, the imperfections. They are always anxious, worrying their koi aren't eating right or the water temperature isn't perfect."

"These second kind of koi people are so focused on perfection, everything falls short and their only happiness is in thing sbeing less imperfect. They're never happy. You need to ask yourself if you are after happiness or perfection. And if it's the latter, you need to decide you're ok with being anxious and unhappy all the time."

It was a startling lecture, but it served me very well. I took it to heart and stopped oevaluating koi and ponds and my own experience in terms of how far it fell short of perrfection. And the lesson served me especially well, when I applied it to my other hobby, coffee.
