### the story of the first star

A very, very long time ago, there was a star. It was much more massive than the star that lights our sky, maybe ten or twenty times as massive. It shone for a very long time, its spent nuclear fuel forming a great, iron-rich core. The nuclear fuel within this core burned out first, and the core shrunk until the only thing preventing it from further collapse was [electron-degeneracy pressure], the quantum resistance of electrons from occupying the same place and state.

[electron-degeneracy pressure]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_degeneracy_pressure

As the star surrounding the core continued to burn, it deposited even more mass upon the core, and then suddenly the gravitational force overcame the electron-degeneracy pressure and the core collapsed even further. An enormous amount of energy was released, heating it to the point where the iron atoms disintegrated into alpha particles.

The temperature continued to rise, and these alpha particles captured the electrons, forming neutrons. The neutrons packed together more tightly, forming a much smaller, hyper-dense neutron sphere. The rest energy of alpha particles and electrons is higher than the rest energy of neutrons, so the energy freed by the formation of the neutron sphere was released as a blast of neutrinos. This blew what was left of the active shell surrounding the core out into space, creating a [supernova][type-II-supernova].

[type-II-supernova]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_supernova "Type-II Supernova"

We did not see the supernova.

Neither did the dinosaurs, nor any other life on earth. Although it happened far away from where we are now, this happened so long ago that its visible light passed this place long before our star was even born.

### the neutron star

What remained behind was a [neutron star]. Its mass was maybe twice that of our sun, packed into a sphere perhaps 20 kilometers across. Very massive, but not enough for gravity to collapse it even further and create a black hole. But very massive!

[neutron star]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star

The neutron star's tremendous gravity affected everything around it, not just the material within it. It would have been impossible to stand on its surface, but if somehow I travelled back in time to this neutron star, I would have found that while I have a mass of about 86 kilograms on Earth, I would have felt like I "weighed" more than eight *trillion* kilograms on this neutron star.

If I was wearing a headlamp for illumination, I would have been able to see all the way around the nutron star to the other side, because its gravity would have bent light into a semi-circle. And if I decided that this much gravity was not to my liking and I wanted to fly away, I would have needed to accelerate to as much as half the speed of light, just to escape its gravity well.

There are many other incredibly interesting things about neutron stars. They spin. They emit beacons of x-ray energy that sometimes fall upon our earth in regular pulses, creating "pulsars." The remnants of the supernova that they created may envelop them creating a "nebula" that they illuminate with their energy.

One such nebula is the [Crab Nebula], pictured above.

### the collision

Neutron stars do not hang, fixed in space. Nothing really does. Gravity and momentum moves everything around in the dance of the heavens. And from time to time, a neutron star encounters another. Their massive gravities pull them towards each other. They may bend their paths and then continue on their way. Or their immense gravities may create a deadly embrace, causing them to spiral towards each other, closer and closer, until they collide.

When they collide, a massive [gravitational wave] is created. Gravitational waves were first proposed by Henri Poincaré in 1905, but most people associate them with Albert Einstein, who predicted them ten years later within the framework of his [General Theory of Relativity], one of the great human intellectual achievements. Humans have been looking for evidence of gravitational waves ever since, but it was almost exactly 100 years later, in 2015, that we detected them, and the results were announced in early 2016.

[gravitational wave]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave
[General Theory of Relativity]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity

In August of 2017, the [Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory] detected a gravitational wave, [GW170817], produced by two neutron stars spiralling together just before they collided. When neutron stars [merge][neutron star merger], they are thought to either create a newer, more massive neutron star, or a black hole if their combined masses are large enough.

[GW170817]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW170817
[neutron star merger]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star_merger

But there is more to the story than that. As noted, their spiralling together creates gravitational waves. A massive magnetic field, trillions of times stronger than that of Earth, is created in milliseconds. And [kilonovae][kilonova] occur, gamma ray bursts and electromagnetic radiation from material that decays as it is ejected from the merging neutron stars.

[kilonova]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilonova

Kilonovae are very interesting. The neutrons in neutron stars are held together by gravity. But material ejected in the cataclysmic merger is no longer held together by gravity. It "decays" back into ordinary matter.

### heavy metal

Physicists have long been interested in heavy metals like gold. The "normal" fusion process within a star does not create heavy substances like gold or platinum. The abundance of such metals on Earth was puzzling. Astrophysicists realized that one way heavy metals might be created would be if an extremely old star, like a red giant, contained lots and lots of of iron.

Iron is created when certain types of stars explode. So for a red giant to contain lots of iron, it would have had to have been created out of stellar materials that contained both hydogen and iron left over from a previous supernova.

As the red star burned, the iron within it would slowly "capture" neutrons thrown off by the fusion reaction. Some of those neutrons would become protons, and the iron would transmute into heavier elements. Some of those would be unstable and decay, and the process would continue until it reached a particularly stable material like lead or bismuth.

This process, called the [s-process], or "slow" process, explained one way that stars might create materials that fusion could not create. But it didn't explain a lot of the matter we find in the universe. It explained strontium, but not gold or uranium. It explained silver, but the predicted amount of silver created was only a fraction of the silver found in the universe. There must have been another process that created heavy elements.

[s-process]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-process

Astronomers came up with another possibility, the [r-process]. What if matter ejected from events like the merger between two neutron stars decayed into elements like uranium, gold, or silver? Kilonovae could explain the amounts of materials like uranium, gold or silver observed in the universe.

[r-process]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-process

Remember gravitational wave [GW170817]? This was produced by the merger of two neutron stars, and unlike the four gravitational waves detected before it, it was independently observed by seventy observatories around earth as its event was accompanied by a massive amount of electromagnetic radiation.

When two black holes collide, there is no observable radiation because their gravity does not allow light to escape. Gravity waves are our only hint that anything has happened. But neutron stars are different. They are massive enough to create gravity waves, but not massive enough to prevent light from reaching us alongside the gravity waves. And that's what happened.

### spectroscopy

Light tells us a lot about the process that created it. [Spectroscopy] is the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation. One form of spectroscopy, atomic emission spectroscopy, identifies the atomic composition of a material that gives off radiation by measuring the amplitude and frequencies of the radiation it emits.

[Spectroscopy]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy

One of the great early accomplishments in science was when astronomers, observing our Sun, noted an unknown yellow spectral line signature. In 1868, Norman Lockyer predicted that it must be created by a hitherto unknown element, which he named "Helium" after the Greek Titan of the Sun, [Helios].

In 1895, two Swedish chemists detected helium in ore samples here on Earth, and in the great tradition of the scientific method, we had a theory, a prediction, and a confirmation of the theory by test.

[Helios]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helios

And this very year, we repeated the process. Astrophysicists had predicted that the merger of two neutron stars would create kilonovae, and that the r-process decay would produce heavy elements. And when those seventy observatories focused on the source of the gravitational wave GW170817, what did spectroscopy reveal?

Gold. Other heavy elements, like platinum. And plenty of them! The theory had passed its test, we knew that gold was produced when two different suns decayed, to produce two neutron stars, that would eventually collide. This confirmation removed yet another objection to the argument that there were things in our universe that science could not explain, that we could not as a species understand.

This was a glorious observation, and you and I were alive to witness the popping of champagne corks around the world.

### the nursery

Remember our neutron star? It wandered, it collided with another star, it ejected some of its matter, perhaps the very chunk that I had--in a thought experiment only--stood upon. It formed a new neutron star, and carried on. But what of its ejected matter?

As we noted, that decayed into various heavy elements, some of which were gold. The matter formed interstellar dust. And while some of it stayed within the gravitational field of the newly merged neutron star, some of it, propelled by the vast energies created in the merger, flew away from the neutron stars to wander, alone, in the universe.

In time, it was attracted by other matter, in a great cloud we call a nebula. At the center of this great cloud, gravity pulled the matter together into lumps. Our matter was gold, but most of the nebula was lighter elements, predominately hydrogen, the lightest element.

Gravity acted to make the lumps lumpier. They sucked nearby material into them. The gravity compressed them together, swirling and spinning, flattening into discs with a massive bump in the center. As they compressed, they heated. At a certain point, when the temperatures at the cores of these super-compressed lumps reached about 10,000 Kelvin, the hydrogen began to fuse into helium.

[Stars were born][Star formation]. The nebula had become a nursery.

[Star formation]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation

![Our Sun](/assets/images/sun.jpg)

### our solar system

One of these stars was about one solar mass. Spinning around it was a huge accretion disc. Gravity within that disc made it lumpy, and the lumps coalesced into spinning spheres orbiting the star. Other lumps passing by were sucked into the star's gravity well and took up irregular orbits. Some begin to orbit the spheres orbiting the stars, forming satellites.

The star was our sun. The third lump from the star was our earth. Our earth was compressing itself under its own gravitational field. The heaviest elements fell to its centre, just as they do in a star. A core of mostly iron formed, just like that star that would birth the neutron star. Our gold fell into it, along with lots of passing uranium.

The uranium was radioactive and decaying. This caused a chain reaction. But not the kind that explodes, there were too many other elements all together, acting like the moderating rods of a nuclear reactor. So the uranium just got hot, and it is still hot to this day. The heat of compression and of this slow burning nuclear decay turned the core to molten metal, with a solid crust on the outside.

At some point, a satellite the size of Mars came crashing into the earth, so hard and so fast that the mantle surrounding the earth was blasted into space, along with the mantle surrounding the satellite. It didn't go far--much of the debris formed a ring around the earth, and gravity eventually compacted it into a single satellite, our [moon]. Our moon is a satellite much larger than our planet's gravity would normally be able to capture, and the [giant-impact hypothesis] is the most supported rationale for how it came to be.

[moon]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon
[giant-impact hypothesis]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant-impact_hypothesis

The earth's iron core formed a huge magnet. An atmosphere formed. Life formed. The magnet bent electromagnetic rays such that it helped to shield life from the universe. Another shield was formed by ozone in the atmosphere. And the moon, the satellite that is much larger than would be expected for a planet our size, formed a third shield, attracting meteors and other flying debris so that extinction-event meteorites would be much more infrequent than expected.

Our world had become a nursery for life. The seas filled with creatures. Many tiny such creatures, when they died, sunk to the bottom of the seas. Their corpses piled up, eventually to be compressed into oil. Other creatures crawled onto the land, and then the land and skies filled with life. Plants developed the wood fibre [lignin]. For a very long time--the [Carboniferous] period--nothing evolved to eat or break down lignin, so when trees died, they did not decay and they too, piled up and would be compressed into coal.

### we enter the story

Life continued to evolve. The most dominant (as we define dominance in our own image) came to be the dinosaurs. Remember the extinction-event meteors that the moon was shielding us from? One got through sixty-six million years ago, the [Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event], forming the [Chicxulub crater].

The dinosaurs were nearly wiped out. The survivors became avians, and the ecosystems the world over changed drastically. A small homeothermic creature that specialized in night-hunting filled the now available opportunities, multiplied, and became a minor success story.

[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous–Paleogene_extinction_event
[Chicxulub crater]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater

One of its descendants walked on its hind legs and became us. We explored, grew, fought each other, became superstitious, discovered science and reason, rejected it, and fought some more. We took the bounty of coal and leveraged it into an explosion of industry and transportation. Later, we mastered oil, electricity, and the terrible nuclear fires.

Having mastered the other creatures, our dominant behaviour became manipulating each other through social engineering. During the Cold War, the two dominant superpowers got into a "Space Race" that was part propoaganda contest, part claim-staking. We turned oil into a rocket fuel called RP-1, and sent humans to our moon.

There, we found evidence supporting the giant-impact hypothesis. Once again, science confirmed what reason suggested. Nevertheless, the superstitious claim to this day that the earth is flat, that the moon landings were faked, that the earth is less than seven thousand years old.

Today, the battle between superstition and science is still hotly contested. But science hasn't gone away. Science made it possible for us to learn this story, and us to share it in this form. We make our machines with science, and in turn, [our machines have made us who we are today][the machine that made us].

### the crown

One day a mere twenty years ago, one of us humans--Raganwald--had a pain in his jaw. He went to a dentist, who used radiation to see what the naked eye could not, to look into solid matter, and to see that Raganwald had an infection in the root of a tooth. The dentist sent him to a specialist, who drilled a hole in the top of the tooth, and then extracted the root without removing the tooth.

The specialist closed the hole with a temporary filling, and when all had healed satisfactorily, Raganwald returned to the dentist, who fitted the tooth with a crown. All was well for about twenty years, but alas, the infection returned. This time, there was nothing to do except remove the tooth.

The dentist removed Raganwald's crown, then the tooth. Raganwald may get an implant put in to replace the lost tooth. But as a souvenir, the dentist gave Raganwald the crown to keep. "It's gold, you can get something for it." Yes, Raganwald could get something for it. Something more valuable than money.

Here it is, Raganwald's crown:

![Raganwald's crown](/assets/images/crown.jpg)

### the lesson

Let us look upon Raganwald's crown:.

Do you now see the matter from a long dead star, that became a neutron star, that danced with, and then embraced, another neutron star, and in their fiery coupling, created this gold? Is this crown not the reminder of its journey from star to planet to crown to this simple plastic box--made from the oil laid down millions of years ago?

And is it not fitting that Raganwald lost his crown the very year that we humans confirmed that its gold had been forged in the collision of two neutron stars, long before our own sun began to shine? Does this not remind us of how small we are, and yet how great is our thirst for learning?

Hark to the lesson of this story: Everything has an explanation.

Some processes may take millions or billions of years to complete. Some conjectures may take a century to be confirmed. But the universe obeys laws, laws that we can discover through reason and scientific investigation. And the arc of human history bends towards reason, not ignorance and superstition.

The loss of Raganwald's crown proves it.
