I read another one of those [Why SHINY-THING is the unsafe choice][lostechies] essays today. It trots out the usual reasonable-sounding arguments:

[lostechies]: http://lostechies.com/bradcarleton/2013/10/23/coffeescript-vs-javascript-dog-eat-dog/

1. The new shiny thing doesn't have a mature toolchain.
2. More people know the old, well-used thing than the new thing.
3. The upside is uncertain.

There's some damning with faint praise tossed in to let you know that the author is open-minded and not a curmudgeon, of course. *And the arguments are not wrong*, so much as they are *irrelevant*. The really interesting thing about any decision whether to switch technologies isn't the technology, ever. It's *whether you want to do what everyone else is doing or not*.

Let me retell one of my stock anecdotes (because every blog rant has to have an anecdote, it's a rule, and because people over forty don't learn anything new or accumulate new experiences, therefore they must retell the same stories over and over for the rest of their lives).

### Wherein I Reason by Anecdote

My friend Anthony and I used to sell Macintoshes during the dark days when [The Usurper Prince John][sculley] had cast the [Rightful King][jobs] out of [Albion]. Nobody wanted to buy one (like Joel Spolsky, my "nobody" means "fewer than ten million people" or so).

You would think that we would have a lot of free time to bemoan our fate as Mac salespeople, but no. Our days would be full of people requesting proposals to sell them Macintoshes. Our office was besieged by people wanting us to demonstrate the Macintosh and its nifty features (I recall that a Macintosh IIfx was wicked-fast and it could drive six monitors at a time, a feat no Windows machine would dare to even attempt at the time).

Did these people buy? No. But they would take up a lot of our time asking "What is the benefit of Mac? Why is it superior to Windows? Explain why we should I buy one for each employee." And at first, we would answer their questions. We would look at their situations and carefully plan out how they would leverage the Mac to obtain a productivity advantage.

You would think that as salespeople on commission, we would have gotten rich. But no, we were poor, because these people did not buy Macintoshes from us. Or our competition. Was the problem Macintosh? Not really, or at least, not in any technical sense. At the time, for many customers, it was the better choice and those that bought Macintoshes were usually very, very happy.

But very few people bought. What happened to the rest? Why did they demur? Well, when it came time to make a decision, they would always say one of two things, either:

> Those features are great, but our organization can't benefit from them.

Or:

> We need those features, but can't handle the learning curve/change for reasons beyond my personal control.

And what we discovered was that what they really meant was:

> Nobody ever got fired for buying a Windows Box.

To almost all of these tire-kickers, buying something different was all downside risk with very little upside risk. Now we can find rationalizations for this and talk about network effects and familiarity and the availability of software titles, but please trust me on this one:

**Those are all rationalizations for the simple choice between "Going with the herd" and "Herd thither, me hither."**

Once Anthony and I figured this out, we stopped asking people questions about their situation and their organization, and we started asking people questions about their personal philosophy. Some people are looking for an edge and like know that you can't do better than everyone else if you do the same thing as everyone else. If someone was of the "Herd thither, me hither," philosophy our job was to explain why Macintosh was a good way to do that.

Our competition for the "Herd thither, me hither's" budget wasn't Windows, our competition was the possibility of taking their entire company one a team-building seminar, or launching a new product, or maybe closing the office and outsourcing it.

Whereas the "Going with the herd" person wasn't going to buy Macintosh no matter what. The herd used Windows. So we'd try to get them out of our office and over to a competitor as quickly as possible. They were a complete waste of our time, because every part of the conversation with them was based on faulty assumptions.

They weren't interested in finding out whether Macintosh was a benefit, they were interested in being able to say to the world that they have an open mind and researched all the possibilities and did their homework and somehow when they had finished up back where they started, using the same damn thing that everyone else used.

The key question we learned to ask was always this: "What other projects and ideas are you looking at to improve your productivity/results?" The "Going with the herd" person always had a list of "catch up with the herd" ideas. The "Herd thither, me hither" person always had a list of things that were all zigs to the herd's zags.

### CoffeeScript vs. JavaScript? Or vs ClojureScript?

And so to CoffeeScript. Or ClojureScript. or using Combinators in JavaScript.

If someone says they tried it and thought about it and think that yeah, if the planets align in some impossible way such that you have a team of wizards working together with mind melds and never have to hire someone new and if all that happens, then maybe, perhaps, CoffeeScript or Clojure or OCaml or Lisp or whatever might work for you...

I always ask myself if they're choosing which edge they're trying to get? Because if so, the argument is going to be CoffeeScript vs. Clojure. Or Ruby vs Python. or OCaml vs Common Lisp. That's the kind of decision a "herd thither, me hither" person makes. And yeah, sometimes they hate CoffeeScript and love ClojureScript. Or insist on a compiled language, provided that language is Haskell.

But if the argument is CoffeeScript vs JavaScript? or Ruby vs. Java? or OCaml vs. C++? You might as well be arguing Moacintosh IIfx vs. Compaq 486. I know the outcome has been decided in advance.

They're going where the herd goes.

And God bless them and theirs, may they dwell amongst my competition for ages upon ages hence.
