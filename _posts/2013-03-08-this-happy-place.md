I just received an email from the nice people at [Leanpub]. To be precise, their computer sent me an email notifying me that the 547th person had just purchased a copy of [JavaScript Allongé][ja]. I'm closing in on 550 readers after three months or so, and that's kind of cool. Thinking about this blogging and book writing journey takes me straight to my happy place.

Now, it so happens that 550 readers is really trivial by technical book standards. The simple fact is that this book, like most of my writing, appeals to the kind of people I call "The few, the proud, the curious."

Best-sellers in technical books are very much like best sellers in software: They are aspirins, not vitamins. They don't promise some vague and hard-to-quantify benefit somewhere down the road, they deliver instant alleviation to pain that people are feeling *right now*.

For example, if you're writing PHP, you probably suffer whenever you need to do anything non-trivial like refactoring. You feel pain. Now.

So when someone like Chris Hartjes comes along with [The Grumpy Programmer's PHPUnit Cookbook][phpunit], you won't find any idle dreaming about someday writing really neat-o code between its virtual covers. There's no namby-pamby as-good-as-it-gets "Reading *The Hipster's Guide to JavaScript Framework Architecture* makes me want to be a better programmer" talk.

Instead, you roll up your sleeves and get to work with a series of recipes for making your life better today. *The Grumpy Programmer's PHPUnit Cookbook* is industrial-strength pain relief for people with PHP migraines.

I understand this and I am happy to say I'm glad that there are pain relievers in the world. I need them too! But part of what makes me happy is a revelation I had a while back: I may not always be in the aspirin business, but I'm not peddling vitamins that may or may not make you a healthier programmer "someday."

No. I'm actually a drug dealer (please supply your own air quotes). I'm in the endorphin business, not the vitamin business.

It's not for everyone, but some people are wired such that when they learn something, a little part of their brain releases some chemicals that make them feel good. **Right away**.

And when they (and by "they," I hope I also mean you!) feel good about whatever it was that turned on those switches, they feel good about other things in their life. They relax a bit. They do a better job when they're happy. They are more creative. They're easier to get along with. They're in their happy place.

*I carry this everywhere I go. It reminds me what business I'm in.*

I help people turn on some switches in their brain that were already there just waiting to be flipped. To turn on the lightbulb that was sitting there ready to pop like flash bulb. And when that happens, **everybody wins**.

The neat part about seeing this part of my life as being in the endorphin business is that I can help people without having to be better or smarter or more successful than they are. Doctors and pharmacists doesn't have to be richer or smarter than their customers.[^notsmart] They just has to be good at curating all the information about drugs and interactions and dosages and then filling little bottles accordingly.

[^notsmart]: I like to say that I'm not smart, I'm just interested in the same things that smart people are interested in. This helps me write a book about programming without torturing myself with thoughts that I'm a charlatan or [impostor].

Returning to [JavaScript Allongé][ja], it so happens that in addition to flipping some switches, I also throw in some recipes for using what it shares. But to tell you a secret... They're there because if you do use something, the light goes on *again*. Including some practical applications is like boosting my dope with a time-released extra dosage.

So it's Friday afternoon, and I'm about to close my laptop and go on "Daddy Duty" for the week-end. And if my kids should happen to ask,

"Daddy, what do you do?"

I will tell them, *I help people make themselves smarter and happier.* And thanks to that email, I know that out there, somewhere, somebody is feeling good. When I read it, *I* felt that rush. I felt happier and more creative and smarter.

It's a win-win, being in the endorphin business. So to all of you who read what I write, or give me feedback, or have told me over the years not to give up, or even are just out there lurking, thank you.

We're all in this happy place together.
