Author Ted Sturgeon was once asked why he wrote Science Fiction, when anyone could see that 90% of the genre was crud. Ted famously replied that "90% of everything is crud." This is now known as "Sturgeon's Revelation," and it's one of the most important insights to carry into any analysis of people and the things we do.

> I repeat Sturgeon’s Revelation, which was wrung out of me after twenty years of wearying defense of science fiction against attacks of people who used the worst examples of the field for ammunition, and whose conclusion was that ninety percent of SF is crud.
>
> Using the same standards that categorize 90% of science fiction as trash, crud, or crap, it can be argued that 90% of film, literature, consumer goods, etc. are crap. In other words, the claim (or fact) that 90% of science fiction is crap is ultimately uninformative, because science fiction conforms to the same trends of quality as all other artforms.—[Ted Sturgeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon's_Law)

For example, recently my friend-at-a-distance (and excellent [author](https://shiprise.dpdcart.com)) Avdi Grim wrote about the dynamic of startups trawling for labour and using the word "passion" to mislead people into thinking that 80+ hour weeks creating the next mobile photo-sharing social network is a noble cause.

Ninety percent of the companies looking for passionate people *are* full of shit. How does Sturgeon's Revelation help us with this? It tells us that *It's ok for 90% of companies to be crud*. This is normal. 90% of everything is crud, including 90% of the job opportunities.

Someone else pointed out that in his experience, passion is a bad thing for a programmer, that it can be counterproductive and/or ruin lives. I know this to be true, I consider myself a passionate programmer, and it is a very expensive value to hold.

Sturgeon's Revelation to the rescue again: So what if 90% of the people who are actually passionate are unproductive to their employers and/or colleagues? 90% of everything is crud, that's ok.

I'll say it again: **It's ok for some group of people to be 90% crud**. This is the normal case. As Ted Sturgeon says, such observations are uninformative, because they don't really tell us anything we don't already know.

### can passion be used as a hiring filter?

Let's turn to a practical matter. If 90 of the passionate programmers are crud, perhaps we shouldn't hire any passionate programmers? Let's try it. We advertise for a job with a web form, and we ask programmers whether they are "passionate." If we get 100 responses, of which ten are worth interviewing, and one is worth hiring, what happens if we discard every applicant who answers "Yes" to the question "Are you passionate?"

Well, the more passionate people we have, the more trouble we're in. If 50% of the people answer "yes," we end up with 50 applications. The fifty we threw way contained 45 cruddy people and 5 good people. The fifty that remain contain 45 cruddy people and 5 good people. We just cut our chances of hiring the one good person in half.

Of course, people who discriminate aren't trying to cut their chances in half. They're trying to throw away 50 applications and be left with all ten people worth interviewing, or maybe nine good interviews out of fifty resumés. What went wronG?

What's wrong is this: **The observation that 90% of passionate programmers are crud is not helpful unless you can also say that programmers who aren't passionate are non-crud. And that simply isn't true.**

There's plenty of crud to be had amongst people who are in it only for the money, or are moderately enthusiastic, or whatever point you may pick along a continuum from "actively hostile to passion" to "indifferent" to "passionate."

Here is the bottom line:

### 90% of everything is crud

We are in an industry where 90% of *everything* is crud. 90% of the programs. 90% of the programmers. 90% of the companies. 90% of the tools. [90% of the books](https://leanpub.com/u/raganwald). 90% of the blogs. It's crud everywhere you look.

When you realize this, you realize that negative indicators like "passionate" or "wrong-gender" or "uses tools I don't respect" or "has funny accent" or "works for evil company" are useless. *The only indicators that matter are the positive indicators, the ones that correlate strongly with being non-crud.*<sup>1</sup>

We are entitled to claim that 90% of the companies advertising for passionate people are crud, and we're entitled to claim that 90% of the passionate programmers are crud. But nobody has established that not advertising for passionate programmers correlates with being a good employer, and nobody has established that not being passionate correlates with being a good programmer.

Therefore, Sturgeon's Revelation tells me that "negative" indicators like passion are like Science Fiction. They are uninformative, because 90% of everything is crud.

1. Observational bias is another matter, of course. If you only hire people just like you, it's amazing how easy it is to find people just like you who seem to get along with you.
