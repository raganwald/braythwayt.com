title: Wherein I Tell Steve Ballmer What To Do
---

It has been a while since I called up one of the world's richest and most successful businessmen and told him how to run his business, so here's a little something for Steve Ballmer at Microsoft.

### what to do

You're going to start a startup.

This needs to be stealth, I suggest funding it personally out of one of your tax shelter investment vehicles. Do not tell anyone at Microsoft what you are doing. Hire some indie-looking people, they can be actors or models. Buy [Vooza](http://vooza.com) if need be.

Launch a kickstarter with some great promos and prototypes, but not too great. You're going to boast that you are creating a new phone, you have some prototypes, but need some moolah to get production going in China. Spin a nice tale. Pass one of your talking heads off as an ex-Microsoftie, another as a Googler, make it seem credible.

Meanwhile, I want you to white-label Windows Phone. Rip all your branding out, even the stuff you can find if you do a software tear-down and go snooping resources. Rip it the fuck out and make this look like something an indie group would design.

People will cotton on to how it looks like Windows Phone, so be up front and say, "We liked some of the design ideas from Windows Phone, but hated X, Y, and Z."

Then cut features X, Y, and Z. Any three features will do, but if you want to hit this out of the park, make them legacy enterprise-y things that the kind of people who buy indie stuff hate reflexively.

### the stretch goal

Now set a stretch goal for your kickstarter. You want to raise say, $50,000 but if you get $150,000 you'll launch a tablet version of the OS.

You're a smart man, so I'm guessing you know I'm going to suggest ripping your branding out of whatever the fuck you're calling your touch screen thingie this week, is it "Windows Tablet Experience, Home Edition?"

Needless to say, your faux-indie fake company needs something snappier. Try to pretend you're actually poor and just make something up. I don't care that you can afford a marketing study, don't do it! Just call it something cute like *KittensOS* and move on.

### astroturf

Now launch this kickstarter and spend your money astro-turfing Reddit and YCombinator and Twitter. For cash money, I'll pimp it like it has a mattress tied to its back.

If you don't get $50,000, spend the rest of your budget hiring goons to punch my lights out, I'll understand. You need to establish that people are not to fuck with you. But I think you'll hit your stretch goal.

So ship your fake phone and carry on astro-turfing. I bet people love it.

### the payoff

Now do the big reveal. It's Windows Phone! And the tablet is Windows Touch Thingamajig!! You people are blogging and tweeting about how much better this thing is than Windows and iOS, and it's actually Windows.

Buuuuuuuuuurn! The faithful will laugh themselves silly and that will be the end of the defections to iPhone. A few new people will like Windows Phone, that's a good thing.

And you'll have learned that brand equity can actually be worth negative dollars. You can think about that the next time you want to launch something worth using.
