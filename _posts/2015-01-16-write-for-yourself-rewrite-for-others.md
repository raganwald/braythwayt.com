Louis CK gave a moving tribute to the late George Carlin. The entire tribute is amazing, but his story of how George Carlin influenced him is poignant.

At one point when Louis CK was struggling, he was delivering the same fifteen year-old material. He noticed that George Carlin was not telling fifteen year-old jokes: George threw out his material *every year* and started fresh with a blank sheet of paper.

This constant renewal of material forced George to constantly observe life, to constantly find insights, and to constantly invent new ways to haack past all of our filters and defenses, using jokes to help us face the uncomfortable, surrelistic, or just plain oddball things we humans do.

Louis CK's career and life changed when he comitted to renewing his act, to throwing his existing jokes out and regularly facing a blank page. He describes this as forcing himself to go deeper into his hopes, fears, and even the things he dreads. Throwing material out and starting fresh. It's very powerful.

Comedians make observations,[^1] wrap them in a joke, then tell the jokes in a performance. Comedians that keep their material for a long time emphasize performance over observation. Comedians that throw their material away emphasize observation. When Louis CK started to throw his material away, he grew as a comic. Not immediately, mind you, it took time. But he grew.

[^1]: Some distinguish "telling jokes to create humor" from "using humour to communicate observations." I am speaking of the latter when I use the word "comedy."

### writing and rewriting

I feel like there is a parallel to writing and rewriting. For me, the main thing in writing something for the first time is the observation, discovering something and working ouut what it means. Writing about an idea is a way of menifesting it. It's a forcing function that gets me to explore an idea in some reasonable depth.

If I share that writing, perhaps as an essay on the internet, perhaps it's a talk I give at a conference, I have an audience who can critique the idea. This forces me to make some reasonable standard of quality. I don't mind being wrong, but I don't want to  embarass myself. An essay might read like stream-of-consciousness, but it shouldn't read like drubken raving.

But really, truly, the big work of writing for me is taking an idea from a glimmer to exposition. That is hard work, I have spent weeks full-time getting a conference talk to flow. But that work is mostly thinking and organizing. For me, a presentation at a conference is just the "tip of the iceberg." This presentation took me weeks to prepare, and it was over in forty-three minutes:

I never gave it again, so that peparation time isn't amortized over multiple presentations. Furthermore, I haven't been able to refine the presentation, to incioporate feedback, go become more comfortable delivering the talk as a speaker.

In fact, I ad-libbed the specific words I spoke, which I always do with my talks. I don't work off a script. If something feels awkward, I have to just plow ahead. If you watch the whole thing, you'll see there was a techncial problem with the A/V, a problem I might have been able to prevent in future performances.

By only presenting a talk once, I maximize the observing and writing. I also minimize the performance. The net result is good for me, because I've grown as a person by going through the writing process. By never giving the same talk twice, I've grown as a person by forcing myself to dig deeper and find things that matter to observe.

*I write for myself*.

### rewriting

This is a discussion about comedy between Ricky Gervais, Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock, and Louis CK. And they talk about repeating the same material. The people who've seen your act before don't usually enjoy seeing the same thing again, but the people who haven't seen the act before get even more out of it, because comedians polish their acts, they remove the bad bits, they move things around.

Jerry Seinfeld has a different approach. He's a perfectionist. He says he has some material that's several decades old, he's still working on being able to deliver it perfectly, withe the right timing, the right intonation, the right anticipation of the audience' reaction. That doesn't make him better or worse than Louis CK, it makes him different. He emphasizes performance.

With talks, I believe that the audience benefits from speakers that spend more time on performance. Some speakers I know deliver the same talk many times. They are terrific performers. Some excellent speakers—[Denise Jacobs] comes to mind—have given me great feedback on how to be a better speaker. They rarely say anything about my material, but boy do they spot a lot of ways I could improve my delivery.

That matters. Better delivery communicates the idea better. That means the audience benefits. Audiences win when speakers are great performers. By performing more, I'd be a better speaker. By iterating over the same talk multiple times, I'd give better talks.

To me, giving the same talk multiple times is like "rewriting." Fixing bugs, moving things around, dropping inessentials.  Rewriting makes writing better. In the case of talks, it makes performance better. Rewriting is a massive win for audiences.

*I rewrite for others.*

### writing and rewriting software

In software, it's the same damn thing. The first go-'round of an idea is like crack cocaine for the puzzle-solving mind. That first algorithms written solve the big problems. The first iteration of a product establishes whether there's something there that the market wants.

Writing software is something I very much do for myself. And boy, would I love to be able to walk away from a beta and start writing something else. That's exactly what I do with my libraries and side-projects. I wrote most of them for myself, to explore ideas, to observe an phenomenon, to discover what was possible.

But just like talks, *rewriting* is where you build value for people that actually use what we write. It's when we fix bugs, things that usually aren't a major part of the idea, but need to be fixed for someone to use the product. Rewriting is when you clean up algorithms that felt like accidental complexity, so you just slapped something in that worked. But now you make it fast, so you stop thinking about the idea and start thinking about the icky implementation of the idea.

And when we have colleagues, we submit a pull request and then get to rewrite the code to be more readable, to match our team's style, to fit better with the code base. All things that add very little value to our personal understanding of the problem, so our urge is to stop doing that as soon as possible and move on to fresh writing.

But if we want to actually deliver value, we need to iterate. To practice. To rewrite. In software, rewriting is how we make value for people.

Think about a big piece of software you admire. Why is Linux valuable? Not because of the initial insight, but because of its relentless rewriting, the constant flow of contributions. The core idea is done, baked in, long finished. The writing is mostly over. But it's the rewriting that matters.

JavaScript is incorporating a `class` keyword. This is a classic example of rewriting and refining. It's not a "big idea" like promises or even proxies. It's not very glamerous, the people who don't like OO complain abut it being unecessary, and the peopel who do like OO complain that it ignores recent research. Like most rewriting, it serves its users at teh expense of its implementors, who'd probably be just as happy figuring out how to add gradual typing to ES-7.

It's not glamerous, but it's an inescapable truth: *We write software for ourselves, we rewrite software for others*.
