So last week, I quoted a fellow who became a billionaire. I won't repeat his name here, the salient point is that he *boasts* of the fact that he placed cultural homogeneity above nearly all other factors when hiring. To be specific, if you weren't an almost identical match to the existing team, you weren't hired.

The example he quotes is that they found a perfect engineer who passed all their tests and so forth with flying colours, until he mentioned casually that he was going to go "shoot hoops." And with that, he was a NO HIRE. Not only did the rest of the team eschew basketball, they would never use those words to describe it.

What I like about this story is that it plays directly into my Faustian prejudices. I'm glad that he became a billionaire. I'm not in the least surprised that the company he created is well-known for its arrogance. It fits my little world view to think that a company that discriminates can be successful.

I don;t need to make up little stories about how a diverse team can make you more successful, or about how you can pick up talent that other companies overlook because the people are the wrong gender or colour or too short or too old or Canadian or whatever.

To me, the pursuit of money as an end in itself is amoral. You are faced with many, many choices every day that are between some principle you hold and making an extra buck. What makes something a **value** rather than an opinion is that you value it. Meaning, it's worth something to you.

If having plenty of women and men on the team is a value of yours, you are willing to live with making a few dollars less while you iron out some cultural problems and get everyone working together harmoniously regardless of the baggage they were carrying when they were hired.

If freedom of speech is a value of yours, you are willing to live with one of your employees making a personal tweet that pisses some people off. You tell people that freedom of expression is your value just as freedom to choose a vendor that censors their employees is theirs.

A word where "doing the right thing" made you richer, more popular, and also morally comfortable would be a world where there effectively was no freedom of choice. That isn't our world.

Our world is one where the things that give us the most personal satisfaction aren't always the ones that make us rich or famous or popular. We have to sacrifice. We have to make difficult choices. We have to ask ourselves whether we truly value our positions.

That person I mentioned did not value diversity as much as he valued a billion dollars. Maybe you do, maybe you don't. But what makes diversity a *value* is the fact that sometimes, you have to choose between the money and the principle.
