### a little bit of history

>  Why are you still here? Why aren't you reading the book online, for free?

> Oh, you've already read the book and are waiting for the barista to pull you a quad shot. In that case, here's some background as to why I'm making the book free.

Not-so-long-ago, I zigged whilst my employer zagged, and I found myself unemployed. I was feeling very positive about the future, so I decided that as far as a "job" was concerned, I was going to aim as high as I possibly could. I had a consulting gig to help with the bills, so I spent the next *twelve months* being extremely picky about what I looked into.

Not picky as in "Does it pay one million dollars?" But picky as in "Would I find myself waking up at four in the morning and hopping online to flesh out an idea concerning work." (As I did five hours ago).

Along the way, I did a lot of writing. It's good for me to write, it helops me clarify my thoughts. Most of my essays are, as Paul Graham would say, attempts to essay or venture out and see how a thought fits in the world. I blogged quite a bit about programming and about the freedom of ideas.

I even accepted five conference invitations, thinking (correctly) that writing a presentation engages my brain as much as or more so than writing an essay. Conferences are rare for me, I am extremely shy. (I don't attend our Toronto Rails Pub Nights, so most Toronto Rubyists have never met me. Some are suprised to hear that I'm a Canadian!)

A lot of what was on my mind and still is on my mind is how "information wants to be free." I believe that economies that share outperform economies that don't. I believe that information multiplies in value as it spreads. This the other selfish reason that I write: The more I share, the richer we all become. We discussed this idea on [the JavaScript Jabber podcast](http://javascriptjabber.com/070-jsj-book-club-javascript-allonge-with-reginald-braithwaite/) earlier this year.

I am very committed to this idea of sharing. I campaigned, hard, for a job on the Firefox OS team at Mozilla. I really wanted to work on developer tools for Firefox OS. I believe that bringing another 10,000,000 or 100,000,000 or even 1,000,000,000 online with smart devices is going to be a tremendous opportunity for the world becoming a better place.

And not just in terms of "Oh look, 1,000,000,000 more people to join our social gossip-sharing gamified site," but also in terms of there being another 100,000, 1,000,000 or even 10,000,000 new programmers writing programs to solve problems that we can't even imagine as we sip our tasty espresso. How do we help them program? I'm super-stoked by where Mozilla is going with this, and likewise I'm so excited I can barely sit still when I look at what people are doing with things like [Squeak](http://squeak.org/) or [Light Table](http://www.chris-granger.com/2012/04/12/light-table---a-new-ide-concept/).

### and so

You can talk about making the world a better place, and you can roll up your sleeves. So, I rolled up my sleeves and wrote [JavaScript Allongé](https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge/read).

I'm a big believer in iteration. So, I started out with an "intentional pivot." I wrote another book called [CoffeeScript Ristretto](https://leanpub.com/coffeescript-ristretto/read). I figured that I would learn a little about writing books from the experience, and that would prepare me to write JavaScript Allongé.

From the start, *I chose to charge real money*. There is an important idea here that asking for money was a way to force me to write good books and create something valuable up front. I was constantly asking myself, "Am I creating more value with this writing than getting a Ruby gig?" Knowing you are going to ask for money changes the way you write. It was also a way for me to measure my ability to add value after the fact. If a book has free downloads, what does it mean to have 1,000 or 2,000 or 5,000 or even 50,000 readers?

But one paying customer... That's a thing, that's proof that you've created the perception of value. Combine that with a 100%, no-questions-asked, money-back guarantee, and what have you got? A very good idea of whether what you're doing is valuable to people. Furthermore, I wasn't working. So ever paying customer was paving another few inches of "runway," to use the startup metaphor. My readers were buying me time to improve the book and time to find my own next dream to pursue.

The book is barely a blip on the publishing scene when we judge JavaScript Allongé against titles like "Get your dream job as a Web Developer in 21 Days!" Those kinds of books sell bythe container-load. But nevertheless, people read it and tell me that it levels them up, and AFAIC that is a success. And as a bonus, I got *my* dream job, and now it's time for me to walk the freedom talk. I'm now working for a company that is trying its dambdest to help every single programmer on the planet write more software and better software. And we give something away, crossing our fingers that more software and better software will be a good thing and that we'll make enough to keep doing what we do.

I believe in this. That's why I write, and that's why I work at [GitHub](https://github.com). And you helped me get here:

Part of why I believed in myself enough to go through the terrors of interviewing for my job is the confidence **you the readers** gave me when you supported my books and told me that the ideas I was trying to share were useful. I can't thank you enough for that.

Be well, and may your ideas multiply upon themselves and spread to the furthest corners of the universe. And [share the book!](https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge/read)
