This morning I had the honour of keynoting the [wroc_love.rb](http://wrocloverb.com) conference. I gave a fairly informal talk called "The Not-So-Big Software Design." The slides are [online](http://braythwayt.com/assets/The-Not-So-Big-Software-Design/).

As I said at the time, this was a "Do as I say, not as I do" talk. I argued for code that hides the inessential and communicates it purpose, yet the talk itself meandered around the subject and was more implicit than explicit about its message!
